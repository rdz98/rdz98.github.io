## About Me

I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student from the college of computer science and technology, Zhejiang University.
I have a background in artificial intelligence research, but my current interests are shifting towards the intersection of AI and neuroscience.
Specifically, I focus on leveraging AI technologies to develop descriptive and interpretable models of cognitive vision.
I believe this field holds immense potential for advancing our understanding of both AI and the brain.
If you're interested in collaboration, I would be delighted to connect and explore opportunities together.

## Research Interests

- **Computational Neuroscience:** cognitive vision, brain-computer interfaces
- **AI Privacy & Security:** privacy-preserving computation, backdoor attacks 

## News
